# Forecasting Solar Power Generation

## Introduction

This project focuses on forecasting solar power generation using advanced machine learning models, including XGBoost and Random Forest. Utilizing a dataset obtained from Kaggle, the project encompasses comprehensive steps such as data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Dataset Acquisition
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, containing historical data on weather features and solar power generation.

### Data Quality Assurance
* **Missing Values:** Handled missing values through imputation or removal to maintain data integrity.
* **Outlier Detection:** Identified and addressed outliers to prevent distortion of model training.
* **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets to facilitate unbiased evaluation of model performance.
* **Feature Scaling:** Features were scaled using StandardScaler to enhance model stability and convergence during training.

## Feature Engineering

* **Cyclical Feature Extraction:** Time-based features such as DaySin, DayCos, YearSin, and YearCos were created to capture seasonal and cyclical patterns inherent in solar power generation data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Data Distribution Visualization:** Histograms were used to visualize and understand the distribution of each feature.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Investigated relationships between features and the target variable (SystemProduction) to identify key predictors.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Conducted to observe trends, seasonality, and anomalies in solar power generation.

## Model Development and Evaluation

### Model Selection
Various regression models were evaluated, including:
* Linear Regression
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting Regressor
* XGBoost

### Model Performance Metrics
Models were assessed using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | 0.637294 | 52.1485 | 4.0848 | 9.39 |
| Decision Tree | 0.715784 | 39.1776 | 6.2581 | 1.82 |
| Random Forest | 0.902032 | 20.3694 | 4.5132 | 1.98 |
| SVR | 0.041909 | 102.6813 | 10.1333 | 7.23 |
| XGBoost | 0.882280 | 28.5447 | 5.3422 | 1.62 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.862676 | 30.3851 | 5.5123 | 1.18 |

## Hyperparameter Tuning

* **Optimization:** Utilized RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for the top-performing models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost), resulting in enhanced predictive accuracy.

## Feature Importance Analysis

* **Key Features Identified:** Analyzed feature importance to gain insights into the model's decision-making process. Radiation, sunshine, and air temperature emerged as significant predictors of solar power generation.

## Conclusion

The Random Forest Regressor was identified as the best-performing model, achieving an R-squared score of 0.90. The project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in forecasting solar power generation, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing solar energy production.

## Future Work

Future enhancements could include:
* Implementing advanced neural network architectures (e.g., LSTM) for better time series forecasting.
* Exploring additional weather features or external data sources to improve model accuracy.
* Conducting sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of different features on model predictions.
